# 🏭 Manufacturing Performance Analysis & Power BI Dashboards  
### Graduation Project – Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)

This project is an end-to-end industrial analytics solution designed to analyze and improve factory performance.  
It focuses on identifying production bottlenecks, reducing downtime, improving product quality, and boosting OEE through data analysis and visualization.

---
## 🔍 Project Overview
Factories often struggle with high defect rates, unstable machine performance, and frequent downtime.  
Our goal was to convert raw machine and production data into actionable insights that support fast and accurate decision-making.

This project was developed as a **Graduation Project for the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Improve product quality & reduce defects  
- Increase machine efficiency and stability  
- Identify bottlenecks in production lines  
- Enhance OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)  
- Build dashboards that support operational decision-making.

## 🔧 Data Processing Workflow
### **1. Data Collection**
Daily/hourly readings for:
- Production  
- Machine speed  
- Downtime  
- Defect types  
- Product & machine type  

### **2. Data Cleaning**
- Remove duplicates  
- Handle missing values  
- Fix incorrect data types  
- Outlier detection & treatment  
- Standardize formats  
- Validate accuracy & consistency  

### **3. KPI Modeling**
We computed industry-relevant KPIs such as:
- **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)**  
- **Availability**  
- **Performance**  
- **Quality**  
- Downtime rate  
- Speed vs Target
